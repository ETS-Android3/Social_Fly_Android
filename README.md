# SocialFly
Messaging apps have changed the way we communicate with each other.

We love the convenient, natural nature of it so much we happily opened our minds and personal messaging channels to conversations with businesses. It doesn't even have to be human-to-human.

Moreover, after the pandemic crisis, consumers are not so opposed to messaging automation either. All in all, the advantages of instant messaging apps marketing will be hard to ignore in 2021.
